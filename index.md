It's **Peng** here(or just call me Bob).

I am looking for 2026 Spring/Fall intake Ph.D in Finance/Fintech as well as artificial intellgence interdisciplinary works would be preferable. 

Currently, I worked as a research asscioate under the guidence of [Prof. CHEN chen](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/chenchen2020) in Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), meanwhile I'm collaborating with researchers with similiar interests.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, email me at *yifengpeng[at]link[dot]cuhk[dot]edu[dot]cn* or schedule a [Online Coffee Chat](https://calendly.com/heliumbob/how-about-an-online-coffee-with-helium) with me.

## Research Interests

- Artificial intelligence generative content(AIGC) and its Application in decision making
- AI Alignment [(A quick guide for AI Alignment Problems)](https://alignmentsurvey.com/)🔗
- Behavorial Finance (Investor Sentiment/emotion; Cognitive bias under information asymmetry)
- Experimental Finance/Neruofinance/Neuroeconomics (I'm just a beginner in this field)
- Alternative data mining (The usage of multimoal data with AIGC)
- [My latest research proposal (December 2025)](https://heliumpeng.github.io/file/Research_Proposal20261201.pdf)🔗
- [Another research proposal (June 2025)](https://heliumpeng.github.io/file/RP_Peng-630.pdf)🔗

My current research focuses on the **Alignment Problem** in Large Language models (LLMs), I'm also a fan for **Behavioral Finance**, with a heart for bounded rationality. Hoping that AI can liberate productivity and benefit mankind.

Try to find a connection between human behavior and machine behavior, LLMs were trained by biased data (Researchs were done to make sure no harm to human, but how to avoid potential future harms when everyone use it everyday in multiply field?), and human were influenced by the biased information, we would face a future together with AI, how to make the AI more aligned with human values is the key point of my research.
