# Research Projects

## [RIGMS Testbed]

*Real-time Intelligent Garbage Monitering System ([RIGMS Testbed]) for IoT Cybersecurity Using Machine Learning Based Approach*

1. Responsible for the establishment and improvement of the Real-time Intelligent Garbage Monitoring System (RIGMS) Testbed for IoT cybersecurity research;
2. Master basic machine learning algorithms, further explore the design of IoT cybersecurity algorithms, and apply machine learning approaches to prevent IoT multiple-mix-attacks;
3. Until to now, have obtained a series of experimental data, and carried out corresponding data preprocessing, preliminary result analysis, and algorithm evaluation;
4. Still under working that will be finalized in Feb 2023, and the latest manuscript can be found [here](https://caihanlin.com/mypaper/202210camb.pdf) (30th Dec 2022).

## [Deep ResNet for TSDS]

*Deep Residual Neural Network (RNN) for Efficient Traffic Sign Detection System (TSDS)*

1. This paper has proposed a deep residual neural network (RNN) model for traffic signs detection system (TSDS) research. Experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of implement RNN model for traffic sign detection and recognition;
1. Moreover, a new systematic analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method for model performance evaluation have been suggested, which is sufficient for deployment in the practical performance measurement of deep learning model;
1. **News!** This paper have been accepted to ICAROB 2023. The manuscript [can be found here](https://caihanlin.com/mypaper/202302ICAROB.pdf).

## [Garbage Manager]

*Intelligent Garbage Management System for Urban Communities: [Garbage Manager].*

1. Took charge of the software and hardware interface part of the IoT Monitoring System, thousands of lines of high-quality and efficient code writing, and the technical documentation preparation of this system;
1. Grasped the comprehensive knowledge of IoT systems and learned how to connect software with hardware and how to use cloud computing to process IoT-generated data, etc.;
1. Penned a paper named An IoT Garbage Monitoring System for Effective Garbage Management and will report on this project as a presenter at IEEE CENIM in Nov 2022.
